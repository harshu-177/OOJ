# ***OOJ Lab Programs:***

1. Develop a Java program that prints all real solutions to the quadratic equation
ax 2 +bx+c = 0. Read in a, b, c and use the quadratic formula. If the discriminate b 2 -4ac
is negative, display a message stating that there are no real solutions.

2. Develop a Java program to create a class Student with members usn, name, an array
credits and an array marks. Include methods to accept and display details and a
method to calculate SGPA of a student.

    File Name : [Student Class](https://github.com/harshu-177/OOJ/blob/main/Code/Student.java)

3. Create a class Book which contains four members: name, author, price, num_pages.
Include a constructor to set the values for the members. Include methods to set and
get the details of the objects. Include a toString( ) method that could display the
complete details of the book. Develop a Java program to create n book objects.

    File Name : [Book Class](https://github.com/harshu-177/OOJ/blob/main/Code/Book.java)

4. Develop a Java program to create an abstract class named Shape that contains two
integers and an empty method named printArea( ). Provide three classes named
Rectangle, Triangle and Circle such that each one of the classes extends the class
Shape. Each one of the classes contain only the method printArea( ) that prints the
area of the given shape.

5. Develop a Java program to create a class Bank that maintains two kinds of account
for its customers, one called savings account and the other current account. The
savings account provides compound interest and withdrawal facilities but no cheque
book facility. The current account provides cheque book facility but no interest.
Current account holders should also maintain a minimum balance and if the balance
falls below this level, a service charge is imposed.
Create a class Account that stores customer name, account number and type of
account. From this derive the classes Cur-acct and Sav-acct to make them more
specific to their requirements. Include the necessary methods in order to achieve the
following tasks:
a) Accept deposit from customer and update the balance.
b) Display the balance.
c) Compute and deposit interest
d) Permit withdrawal and update the balance
Check for the minimum balance, impose penalty if necessary and update the balance.
